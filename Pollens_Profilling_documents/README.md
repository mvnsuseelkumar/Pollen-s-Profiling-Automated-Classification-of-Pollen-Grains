## 🔍 Introduction

### 1.1 Project Overview

Pollen classification is an important task in botany and environmental studies. This project leverages deep learning, particularly CNNs, to build a smart system that classifies pollen grain images automatically. The associated Flask web application offers a user-friendly interface to upload and classify pollen grain images.

### 1.2 Purpose

The purpose of this documentation folder is to provide all design plans, diagrams, reports, and planning material related to the pollen classification system. This ensures transparency, reproducibility, and clarity for future reference or academic evaluation.
